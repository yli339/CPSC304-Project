Our project models the core data system for an online multiplayer role-playing game (RPG). 
The database represents key elements of the virtual world (e.g., players, guilds, pets, items, 
maps, NPCs, enemies, and missions), allowing the game to track player progress, 
interactions, and social connections. This structure ensures consistent persistence of gameplay data and supports the interconnected experience typical of modern MMORPGs.
